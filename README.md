# Groundup
Welcome to Groundup, a decentralized data marketplace that connects data collectors to data seekers. 

We enable researchers, government, and private companies to obtain high quality, hyperlocal, timely data from villages in rural India.

## Getting Started:
- Ensure you are in the Groundup folder
- Check if pip is installed with `pip --version` 
- If pip is not installed, install pip using [Online Guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-and-install-pip-latest-version/) <br/>

#### Run flask:
- Install flask and other required dependencies with `pip3 install [name]`
    - See requirements.txt for a list of all the dependencies that need to be installed
- Create a Python environment with `python3 -m venv venv`
- Execute `. venv/bin/activate` to activate the environement
- Run `flask run` to start the website

#### Run website:
- Check terminal. It should output something like (http://127.0.0.1:5000). Copy and paste into your browser.
- Register as a new user. Choose to be either a data collector or a client. 


## Using Groundup:
#### Sample Logins:
- client username = groundupcli
- client password = groundupcli

- collector1 username = coll1
- collector1 password = coll1
- collector2 username = coll2
- collector2 password = coll2
- collector3 username = coll3
- collector3 password = coll3

Use these logins (which already have associated data) or register new users.

#### Data Collectors:
- Enter your information in your dashboard. This allows clients to see your information on the interactive map.
